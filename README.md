# Nabi ðŸ¦‹

Nabi is currently work in progress. It is a modern C++ ECS engine which I plan to use in my final year at university.

Nabi's core goals are to be: flexible, data driven and testable. 
Its the first time I've written anything like this and it's far from perfect - but I'm happy with it so far :)


This is the development roadmap:
- Core âœ…
- Reflection / xml parsing âœ…
- Rendering âœ…
- Input / UI âœ…
- Physics / Collision ðŸš§
- Audio ðŸ”œâ„¢
- Threading ðŸ”œâ„¢

Nabi's features aren't exhaustive, its just meant to be enough for me to make some cool final year projects without needing an existing engine and learn a bunch a long the way.

Nabi means "butterfly" in Korean - and it is my favourite Korean word!
