Nabi is a custom C++ ECS game engine I wrote as a hobby project while on placement at Playground Games. Its goals were to be fast, flexible, data driven and testable. Its code is far from perfect, but I learned a ton while developing it and am proud of the results :)

You can read more about it on my website [here](https://wzrdistaken.github.io/project%20pages/nabi_project_page.html), and watch a video about it [here](https://youtu.be/n9mT7CknKcM?si=mNLkoGa1w5KH8HDx)!

This is (was...) the development roadmap:
- Core âœ…
- Reflection / xml parsing âœ…
- Rendering âœ…
- Input / UI âœ…
- Physics / Collision âœ…
- Audio âœ…
- Threading âœ…
- Memory ðŸš§ (i'm looking into this for my [FYP](https://wzrdistaken.github.io/project%20pages/nabi_allocator_project_page.html))
- Networking ðŸ”œâ„¢

"Nabi" (ë‚˜ë¹„) means "butterfly" in Korean - and it is my favourite Korean word!
