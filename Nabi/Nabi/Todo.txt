Goals:
- Nabi should be: Fast, flexible, data driven, testable
- For an MVP we need: Reflection, rendering, input, collision, audio, networking(?), core

Current:

// --- Remember when you actually do an assignment... ---
- Have all entity groups / event calls etc as constexpr in a file

// --- Critical Priority ---
- Remember to write a learnings txt doc once finished everything (i've started this in the nabi folder) (example topic: tests)
    - "There are some jank bits, there are some bits I sorely wish I had done very differently, but you know what - I count that as a success, because it means I've learned something.
       If I thought everything was perfect and I did everything right all the time then, well, I probably haven't grown as a developer."
    - See the comment in StringConverter about FromString template specialization. That should go in the write up + the jankness which is container reflection
- Once the test stuff is removed from NabiCore, make sure the engine compiles in release

- Then done! And can look into the error code -1073741510 (0xc000013a) we sometime's get on shutdown (i think this is to do with rendering..?). Also can tidy up this todo txt
    - When nothing is being drawn I dont get the error

- Fix container reflection so it works nicely? do this after the demo etc. If you don't have the time or the will (remember, we have other stuff todo before korea)
  just move this to the nice to have section and make sure its in the write up
- make sure all high prio/critica prio tasks are done / organised and this section looks empty

// --- High Priority ---

Refactor / demo (or seperate branch for this) Branch:
- I think having all the standard includes in one place might actually be dumb.. unless they are pch? Research this. Perhaps standard incldues only should 
  go in pch cos we have the different engine/game levels. but pch is only cpp right..? idk research
    - for standard includes in core/enginecore/etc is it dumb to have like a standard.h file with all the standard includes i use? can include here and in enginecore*/
- Add "Memory" to the development roadmap readme with soontm. if doing memory management as dis can do some test work in in? actually it can be "work in progress.." we might do memory management for fyp

- Put everything together in a game core / project setup how you want it example
    - then right a stress test for it
        - define out the examples in nabicore.. remove the example/test_ calls.. crazy
        - Make loads of asteroids or something and player that can move around. test all of nabis features
        - Check collision id reflection works (might have to make an unsigned long long reflection and use the could be enum func (see what we did for the audio id))
    - should resource components be removed and the memory freed after use? i think this should be a define in the actual game code asset bank
    - should render tags be assigned in xml, or when the model / sprite is loaded in? I think xml

// --- Low Priority ---

- When we make a GameCore, can use m_WindowEventsListener to stop the game rendering when its minimised. might still want it to update thou? idk
- Pixel shader might need to take in an array of lights..? what happens if we have two lights?
	- two lights is acc fine. ngl in all off my projects i wont want complex lighting, so i think what we've got is ok
- The entity clone appending of "_clone" to the entity name might be broken somehow. This isnt super high prio though as the entity group looks ok, and thats more important
- Inline string converter From[Type] functions?
- look into ENTT_USE_ATOMIC / entts multithreading needs
    - I don't think this is needed (rn..), but here is the link if it is https://github.com/skypjack/entt/wiki/Crash-Course:-configuration#entt_use_atomic

// --- Nice to have stuff / random ideas ---

- Log to file functionality for Logger
- Work out how to have the REFLECTION_END macro's not have to take in the type again
- Make it so we dont have to do the typedef thing for reflecting nested types (ie types which have :: in their name)
- Allow reflecting nested custom types and custom types in containers. See the comment in StringConverter.h
- Make it so that the loop is not something that is done by loading.. instead when playing. Could possibly solve this problem nicely by setting a callback on the voice..? 
- Add an assert for entt::get when the get fails? why isnt this a thing? is it a thing and im just dumb? (i think it does exist and im just dumb)
    - Try overriding entt assert with my version
    - I think registry::get might just not have any assert logic and the code is too beyond my tired self to add
- It might be possible to make Singleton's use a static constructor to init themselves as well? But when I did a quick attempt I got a lot of scary linker errors
  and I don't want to go down that road right now!
- Find and fix that incomplete type not allowed (can we do a seperate thing to what we did in google test in entt.h?)
  (ngl i don't think this is possible.. and might well just be visual studio doing visual studio things. if i have an idea i'll do it, but for now i'm decreasing its priority)
- use doxygen comment style?

Archive:
- Should the wincore in include go before or after standard lib? remove the comment in core.h
    - hoesntly i'll just leave it how it is. its been compiling and working all this time so... don't touch it! same with the todo "Wincore above Enginecore?"
- in nabicore update/fixedupdate/render const? decide + remove the /*comment*/ 
    - nope they cant/it would be anoying if someone overrode them anyway
- should i leave more comments in the core systems/components/modules?
    - honestly, probs should - but i think its pretty obvious rn. Anyway, all the functionality is used in the examples / tests and stuff/
      and besides, i probs wont have the time or inclination to write any big comments when i write the ecs code for uni projects.. i'll
      just (try to) write self commenting code and wack a comment in if i do anything odd
- do i want the core ecs namespace to be "ecs?" should it be nabi something..? no... should it be something else..? i think ecs is fine though
    - ecs is fine. what else would it be? cant be something to specific as that will change game to game.. nah ecs is fine
- Too much NABI_NOEXCEPT? noexcept and *nodiscard* in core ecs stuff?  - consider nodiscard now [decided to use it]
- is it possible to fix the "expected a ')'" error with REFLECT_CONTAINER? it compiles/works fine.. if not, then move this to the 'nice to have' section
    - I think this is just caused by the macro maddness which is the hacked in container reflection as it compiles file.
- why does the sprite component exist in the repro? because it was on disk.. i must have misclicked deleting it and pressed remove instead
- TEST loading in ui elements from xml. see test_ui_entities. has it broke? the button isn't responding..? NOPE im just dumb
    - actually look at which ui scenes are enabled / disabled, and what the ui buttons are bounds to in xml..
- Cleaning up old todos:
    - work how why listeners arent being called for the lighting system. also needs to be either the light or transform component changed
    - Forward declare the enums (PixelShader, VertexShader) or switch to enum class (actually cant use enum class in all cases. disable the warning about unscoped enum)
    - Create systems on the heap (with a shared ptr i think) and adjust the initsystems test accordingly. might also have to create them differently in the first place?
      (acc i think this is ok on the stack?)
- Saw the "getting fixed dt but run sim is false" assert while idiling. remove this assert and make it a log warn?
    - I guess its possible to see this assert in normal situaions if the threads get out of sync slightly..?
        - I've made multiple changes since then though and haven't seem the assert again. Perhaps something to consider if I do see it again
- Comments in engine threading code + explanation of why we used a library
- should the thread pool be a ptr in threadingobjects?
- i think this already works but make sure
    - test parsing xml data on another thread
    - test loading data at runtime (eg new rendering data)
- WHY did we have to change the speed. deeper underlying problem? fixed
- Make it so that LOG has to take in a category and a end? (eg, LOG_CATEGORY_AUDIO and NEWLINE )?
    - and a LOG_ENDLINE macro (can just be ENDLINE)
- sprite component cpp + reflection?
- GraphicsComponent -> GraphicsStateComponent (nah... i dont think so..? its not really state like the others... i think?)
- New namespace for resource components. Eg have SComp::, Tags:: and should have Resource::? ecs::Resouce::~ Should I split up these into resource/tag/data folders? YES DONE
    - Just Have CoreComponents [all data components live here], then resource / tag component folders?
    - Also split out all components into seperate files. Rather than eg DrawableComponents
- Audio <-- DONE! :) 17/06/23 @ 22:38 one more feature to go (i hope.........) come on ben
- Test audio looping (AudioCommand::LoadSettings)
- Audio tests
- Audio data should be stored in an asset bank. Need a custom loader and whatever. Rather than going in the audio module
    - Make sure that the audio bank doesnt assert if the resource is loaded more than once. it should ONLY log info. not even a warn (tbh, not even that...)
        - with entity inheritance and whatever, this could be logged a lot. would be trace category probs
- Do I need to call CoInitializeEx(nullptr, COINIT_MULTITHREADED); on startup? YES, done
- Gotta read the docs. As the voices are in a pool now, do I even need to destroy them? they will just be cleaned up at the end anyway. [yes and done]
- Great progress today! Keep it up. Next up is fix this (^) I recon, + make sure shutting down is anyways nice with no errors
- Is there a audio engine . shutdown or similar I need to call>
- See notebook: Raycast, collision/physics tests, then these many todos... come on! lets go dude~   
    - Tests done, just raycast and the todos . will have to write a raycast test though once that is done
- do we need to write a raycast func? probs (not..? idk - decide!). in a collision/physics module? Just this left~! 
    - decided yes! and now its done B) [29/05/2023, right on schedule] run time i think..
- Can also implemnt physics materials like this? Perhaps in data its an enum? Otherwise a string to a function. The signature can contain eg peneration depth, the normal
    and the rb. Then eg the function can modifiy the rb - like a bouncy material.
        - Left a note for this, but currently its solving a problem which doesn't /might never exist
- Make sure all operator overloads are constexpr? and all defaultSettings structs <-- again, no point in finding/refactoring all. just do from now on
- Should the operator functions (eg operator()/++) not have a space? current: 'operator ()', new(?) 'operator()' <-- is this worth doing? probs not. just do from now on
- Make sure all components have a default constructor (inc scomps). Should SpatialHeirachyComponent and EntityInfoComponent go into one file called 'EntityComponents?'
    - No I don't think so, if anything the other components should be split out
- Im done with this Utils::Util class thign. Gotta fix that i recon . Just nabi::StringUtils , for example
- also should probs refactor entity creator, entity property list and entity group out of reflection and into ECS
- Comments in physics stuff
- should float3 be passed by reference? partically in directx utils?
- Is the byte allignment stuff in physics component correct?
- I imagine I just want to have a collider component, the CollisionSystem iterates over all of them and calls a solver in nabi/physics
- need to work out what im doing with computevelocity/computeangular velocity. can the compute/set funcs just be made into 1 and pass in params?
- Also need collision tags. Could this be implemented as some sort of enum bitshifting? 
    - Yes, I think I've done it - just need to test write like one like in CollisionSystem and test it
- Need collision OnCollisionEnter and OnCollisionExit events. This will probs involve having the CollisionStateComponent holding entitiy pairs (structs) of current collisions.
    - This can be implemented like the UI buttons, with refleted functions which are typed in data
        - TODO: TEST THIS
- Collision! Start with some reading (red book / example code)
- velocity = velocity / (1 + drag * delta); ?
- should the physicssystem -> rotation code not times by dt twice? [if we add drag it wont do this i think]
- reflect AABB (not) in basetypereflection (see other core types, only cpp / lib types are in basetypereflection) [not needed]
- Write collision system
- Need to write rotation code for physics system
- Need to actually use the constraints vars
- Rigidbodycomponent should reflect width as radious and height ? actually this wont work cos its a custom type. whatever trevor. just make a note of this
- Its time to write GameTime [CURRENT - Review implementation, search for /*gametime*/ to make sure no where is left out]
- Write some UI tests?
- check everything that needs to be commented is
- enabling / disabling events, and use this in ui system (if cant make this work just use the if) DONE
- make string conventer bool faster with if DONE
- more nabi no except in nabicore? DONE
- namespace ecs::SingletonComponents DONE
- is there a problem with reflection system and values like " hello" which a space? should they be trimmed before FromString is called? YES - FIXED
- see notebook for reflection update idea (pros -> disable update | cons -> more branchs just to update) (put it behind an #define i recon, but still we probs use and then can profile l8r)
    - [this was pain]
- Should the components in the view be const, rather than the components in the lambda? I think so... and then can the components in the lambda just be auto? does that carry const? [yes]
    - or just switch over to the for loop approach [no need]
- A UI storage w/stickys sort of thing? (probs a good idea, as ui scenes are just free funcs, though the actual sticky keys will be a game side thing)
- should all systems modify the input components? eg like the asset bank does with the drawables? (probs not.. ui doesnt load any actual data, rendering does. should be seperate)
- delay_creation
- should all modules take in context first for style/consistency?
- need a way to find sprite dims
- Input! (remember have tested this stuff in the 'learning rendering' proj) (also had that email from jake)
- CheckIfMouseOverElement function in UImodule
- ui
- Write rendering tests
- Fix all warnings / disable those we dont care about
- Comment up all rendering code (also switch over all comment style - doxygen? im not really a big fan of the xml now i know i can change it) (also can xmlparser methods be const?)
- need a way to load/ unload entity groups - does this exist already?
	- when entities are parsed they should be cached in the groups the are in, like they are put in the entity template map. then then can be 'fast' loaded/unloaded 
- make it so the debug/release folders vs creates arent in the solution itself
- Reflect XMFloat3 and all of the other dx types (need to define there from string func and perhaps a new macro/string conventer change)
    - oh, and remember to reflect the UVs struct 
- clean up the entity info component. doesnt need cpp or the settings i dont think
- shader stuff can go into a "Common" file and be included / have the prefix g_. Eg: g_ModelMatrix
- loading resources for the icon (currently its just commented out. needs to be customisable in NabiSettings I recon)
- rename PerMesh constant buffer to PerRenderable? if its used for 2d as well..
- 'Vertex' into 'Containers' and 'RenderBuffers' can be on the same level as the RenderCommand?
- Get sam to review rendering code and see any improvements / make sure everything is clean
- Make sure to include some good logging when the direct x render stuff is starting up / running
- the stuff in nabi core setting up the camera should go in there
- TODO lighting, screen res, moving the model eg pos.x = 500? reszing the screen (try o lighting)
- need a camera system [this will be game specific]
- should the authoring data for sprites / text be "SpriteCompoent" and "TextComponent", because they will both be images under the hood?
- need a skybox
- see like the playground proj can have a 'common' hlsl file with buffers etc.
- idea: could have like CoreRenderer, CorePhysics system etc - no virtual inheritance but can be overriden? idk how that would work thou
- see email for input stuff
- resizing the window
- if not batch rendering commit render system change and strip out the render 2d func . else ... research batch rendering! (yeah i cba)
- look at notebook. do rendering stuff or start on input. probs the later, i am very done with rendering. remember - have already tested this all out in "learning rendering" proj i think
- screen resizing
- if the camera is moved, does the ui move? [update -> not anymore B)]
- work out why we get all of those direct x warnings in the console
- go through change list with a fresh pair of eyes and commit. then.. input???!!
- text. lets go dude
- see notebook. got some refacting do to for a nice 2d system. 
- do we need stb image? did we use if? if not, can remove
- fix that direct x warning spamming the console (asked sam)
- storing the init settings is kinda dumb. work out a better solution with getting hwnd
- 'reflect' spelt wrong with 'reflect system property' macro - rename!
- Add new 'CoreSingletonComponents' folder/filter for graphics/io components. delete the cpp's of these components and the src folder/filter if not needed
- Add the catagory infront of all logging statements. Eg [Rendering] msg or [Reflection] msg - should this be a macro?
- Learn rendering! (im still torn between directx and opengl.. once get an answer from uni hopefully things will become clearer)
- Direct X namespace as dx?
- Entity creator could also live in context? and not be a singleton
- For the model, it doesnt need to contain all of the vectors. Just the index/vertex buffer and the triangle count.
- This triangle count can either in the index buffer or the model (because of how I've done it, it might be easist to have it in the model)
- Use ConstantBufferLoader::AssignShaderConstnantBuffers to add the constant buffers to the vertex shader
- call assert inside the dx exception 
- Fix release mode (nvm that doesnt work..)
- Make project structure more flat
- Core should include standard libs like vec, array, map etc so dont have to include them everywhere
- Check through code where done this and fix accordingly
- And g_ for global vars - eg that inline xml parser one
  #define DELETE_COPY_MOVE_CONSTRUCTORS(Type)     Type(Type&) = delete; \ (this has been created in TypeUtils and included in EngineCore. just need to use it!)
                                                Type(Type&&) = delete; \
                                                Type(const Type&) = delete; \
                                                Type(const Type&&) = delete;
^ For singleton? and anything else 
- If one day we want to NOEXCEPT stuff, include engine core everywhere in engine first thing and do this.
- Split up header files from src files (is this something we actually want to do?)
- Having core in .h and .cpp files is a good idea
- i am actually liking the idea of splitting up the headers and cpp more and more. can acc use engine core and define more functions in cpp
  where it makes sense (eg the string converter stuff) without it upsetting my ocd xD do this i think
- AND move to a .h and .cpp approach
- Rename 'Templates' -> 'Patterns' (https://github.com/dbeef/spelunky-psp/tree/master/src/patterns/interface/patterns)
- name 'rhs' to 'other' in == overrides and stuff
- Have an engine core with defines and NABI_NOEXCEPT in it? Core can become GameCore? (made Engine Utils with NOEXCEPT in it)
- Make functions longer than line 1 line in header files static not inline (eg - the string converter one)
- Can the reflection macro stuff (ie begin, middle, end) go in the cpp not h? if so, dont need the create reflector instance macro and will not pollute the namespace (this does work - should do but need some reflection macro work)
- actually test the math random number generation xd (if it doesnt work, just use normal random - it no longer needs to be the fastest it can be)
- Fix linker error (ask Brandon for help) (it appears when you comment out the use debug utils define in debug mode only) [seems to have magically disappeared???]
- Should c_DefaultEntityGroup go in a different place?
- Gotta sort out the logging, UUID stuff [DONE], and an assert if a entityproperty list is referecning a component/property which doesnt exist [DONE]?
- Once all that is done, clean up code / move comments over / refactor xml parser  - make sure everything is to a good standard
- Can make a function of ResolveEntityComponents i think
- refactor entity info? think [just left a comment - i think the struct is still valid and its a bit of history xd]
- make the comaprison not have a method so test errors appear on the time in the test file they are on
- Dont just sit there stuck. you've already got this working in the xmlparser. carefully review that code with a fresh pair of eyes
  and work out where you're going wrong
- Current problems with the Runtime entity creation stuff
- Custom Components dont seem to be creating properly
- The first is just mangled, and the next look like they are default constructing
- SO close thou dude. DO NOT give up! 
- Remember the goal: Be ready for rendering by the time you go back to leam
- Handle runtime entity creation
- Create anonymous id for entities which don't have names? is this needed? is this entt functionality already which hashed string?
- Debug tag for entities DONE / components / systems DONE / properties in xml (i think this should go in parsesystems, parseentities, createecscomponent, createproperty)
  BUT doesn't actually do what its meant to in debug?? getting a bit tired, so will do this tmoz
- Seperate tests define? and seperate assert define. this will acc be useful and probs a pain to do later so come on!
- Singleton static constructor / fix circular dependency with singleton and debugutils (worst come to worse have like a call assert func with implementation in singleton.cpp)
  Get rid of that big comment in Singleton.h
- could we fix the warning that void(0) log produces in release builds by doing the pragma error thing in release only? (we did in google test)
- Create the assert logic (just do like entt assert? looks pretty simple - just use c++ assert!) [acc wasn't so simple but we've got it done!]
- Some static asserts to make sure log level and the macro match up (see logger todos - comeon dude nearly done with all these todos!!) [no longer needed]
- DOING THIS WILL RESOLVE BELOW: Fix the failing test with mock component!
  I think something link /* .func<&nabi::Reflection::StringConverter::FromString<int>>(nabi::Reflection::ReflectionGlobals::c_FromStringFunctionName) \ */
  In the reflect end will work. This is the problem, no from string defined but enums are ints so should be able to use..???
- https://github.com/skypjack/entt/wiki/Crash-Course:-runtime-reflection-system#named-constants-and-enums
- Write enum tests in reflection (gotta test stand alone and in mock component)
- Check over all changes up to this point and commit. make sure you haven't done anything else dumb... i would do it now but i gotta go pack!
- Remember to update the comment in ReflectionMacros -> enums
- Current WIP: Reflecting enums (wip stuff in ReflectionMacros and StringConverter). Prototype this fully in the test proj first I recon
  Once this is done can fix the todo in Logger.h / tidy up Logger.  (I was being so dumb logger was well easy. and so was enums!!!! ah well, you live and learn)
- Have file lines all line up by inserting some spaces
- Fix circular dependency between Singleton and DebugUtils DONE
- Does DebugUtils need to include IO stream? or can it go in logger cpp? (remember to update core comment) DONE
- Can I std::move systems rather than copying them? try this, and if so try deleting the copy operators again DONE
- with this namespace stuff, remember to to it everywhere. eg with mocksystem etc as well. should we just go lowercase? its not that bad | DOne I dont acc like this
- All final for classes !!! DONE
- Fix google test warnings (or suppress) DONE
- Remove delete rule of 6 stuff from EntityInfoComponent? Will components use this (only if systems do)? If so - put it in the base? DONE
- Need to decide on namespace structure. See mocksystem, mockcomponent
- PERHAPS the component and stuff could just live inside ECS, but anything free eg the create function could have another namespace lv
- Rule of 'if its a class, dont bascially dupe it like ComponentA::ComponentA should stay i recon' DONE
- With singletons, if dont data drive them need the static constructor stuff. if do data drive, then dont. 
  tbh i dont think i need to data drive them, it doesnt make much sense. shouldnt have many singletons anyway. consider the static constructor DONE
- Put Comparison in its own header DONE
- If the MetaObjectLookup map is complaining with entthashedstring, just make the key a u64 or whatever hashed string is under the hood
   ^ ngl i dont think we need to do this as std::hash it already going to be called DONE ****
- Make ConstructSettingsFromComponent functions not inline and have  def in cpp ty brandon DONE
- Also have to solve this ConstructComponentSettings thing.. its real dumb . i think i have just solved.. dont delte the copy constrctor..?? DONE

Info:
All the 'todos' of the project! This isn't all the todos ever, its just since I started tracking them in one place (18/12/2022)
This isn't the best way of tracking stuff I know, but trust me its better than what it was :D
Besides, I like just being able to open up the proj and everything is right there
